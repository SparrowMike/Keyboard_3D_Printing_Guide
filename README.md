## Descriptions

### **MJF (Nylon)**
- **Materials:** PA12, PA11
- **Description:** Multi Jet Fusion (MJF) produces highly detailed, strong, and durable parts. It is excellent for both functional and aesthetic components. MJF Nylon parts are highly suitable for mechanical applications, including keyboard bases and keycaps.

### **SLS (Nylon)**
- **Materials:** PA12, PA11
- **Description:** Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) uses a laser to sinter powdered nylon into solid structures. It is known for producing parts with good mechanical properties and detail. SLS is ideal for robust and complex parts like keyboard bases and keycaps.

### **FDM (Plastic)**
- **Materials:** PLA, ABS, ASA, TPU, PA12-CF (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Nylon)
- **Description:** Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is the most common and cost-effective 3D printing method. It works by extruding thermoplastic filaments layer by layer. While FDM is versatile, the quality and properties of the printed parts vary significantly with different materials.

### **SLA (Resin)**
- **Materials:** Standard Resin, Tough Resin, Flexible Resin
- **Description:** Stereolithography (SLA) uses a laser to cure liquid resin into solid parts. SLA prints have excellent surface finish and detail but can be brittle. Tough resins improve durability, while flexible resins add elasticity. SLA is suitable for detailed keycaps but less ideal for structural parts like keyboard bases.
