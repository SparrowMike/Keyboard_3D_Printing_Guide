## Introduction

This repository aims to provide 3D printing enthusiasts with detailed information on the best printing technologies and materials for creating custom keyboard components. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced maker, you'll find valuable insights and practical tips here.

### 3D Printing Basics

3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a process of creating three-dimensional objects from a digital file. Here are the main types of 3D printing technologies:

- **FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling):** Works by melting and extruding thermoplastic filament, which a nozzle deposits layer by layer to build up the model. It's the most common and cost-effective method.
- **SLA (Stereolithography):** Uses a laser to cure liquid resin into solid plastic in a process called photopolymerization. It produces high-resolution parts with a smooth finish.
- **SLS (Selective Laser Sintering):** Uses a laser to sinter powdered nylon into solid structures. Itâ€™s known for creating strong and durable parts.
- **MJF (Multi Jet Fusion):** Uses a printing head to apply fusing agents to a bed of nylon powder, which are then fused by heating elements. This produces highly detailed and strong parts.

- **Description:** Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) uses a laser to sinter powdered nylon into solid structures. It is known for producing parts with good mechanical properties and detail. SLS is ideal for robust and complex parts like keyboard bases and keycaps.

### **FDM (Plastic)**

- **Materials:** PLA, ABS, ASA, TPU, PA12-CF (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Nylon)
- **Description:** Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is the most common and cost-effective 3D printing method. It works by extruding thermoplastic filaments layer by layer. While FDM is versatile, the quality and properties of the printed parts vary significantly with different materials.

### **SLA (Resin)**

- **Materials:** Standard Resin, Tough Resin, Flexible Resin
- **Description:** Stereolithography (SLA) uses a laser to cure liquid resin into solid parts. SLA prints have excellent surface finish and detail but can be brittle. Tough resins improve durability, while flexible resins add elasticity. SLA is suitable for detailed keycaps but less ideal for structural parts like keyboard bases.

## Best Practices

### Keyboard Cases

- **Mounting Points:** Ensure holes for screws or inserts are appropriately sized.
- **Tolerance:** Account for slight variations in print dimensions by including tolerances in your design.
- **Support Structures:** Design with minimal overhangs to reduce the need for support structures.

### Keycaps

- **Stem Fit:** Ensure the stem dimensions are precise to fit securely on switches.
- **Surface Finish:** Design for a smooth top surface to enhance the tactile feel and aesthetics.
- **Durability:** Choose materials that can withstand frequent use without degrading.
